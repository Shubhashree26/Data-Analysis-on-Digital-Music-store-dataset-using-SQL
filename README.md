# Data-Analysis-on-Music-Store-dataset-using-SQL
**Project for finding some useful insights for business growth of Music Store using SQL**

## Understanding the Dataset:
The Music Store dataset contains total 11 tables. The schema diagram for this dataset is shown below.

![Music Store Database Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120332097/229481375-67157a81-233e-45fa-9373-80a0c432ffcc.png 'Music Store Database Diagram')

In the Music Store dataset, there are few artists. Artists have created their albums and each album contains different music tracks.
Information about albums, artists and tracks is given in individual tables. Tracks belong to different genres and media types; that information is also given in tables.
Customers across the world purchase the music tracks from the music store. Data about these purchases is given in invoice table. Data about the employees of music store who are the support rep for different customers is also given in in employees' table.

## Tools and Database Used:
- Postgre SQL
- pgAdmin 4

I have found out some important and useful insights from the music store dataset by writing the optimised SQL queries in PostgreSQL RDBMS.
